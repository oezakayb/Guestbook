TODO:

-Limit camera zoom out and zoom in. The planet gets half rendered if zoomed in or zoomed out too much.
-?Choice of different texture patterns instead of colors for planet surfaces.
-Directly upload the .glb file to Mozilla Hubs instead of downloading it and doing the upload manually.
-?Option to have a text on the planet surface: If the user types in a text, the text and the material color should be made into a texture, and this texture must be applied. If not, I could not think of another way.
-Belt can be made of metoroids for aestethic.
